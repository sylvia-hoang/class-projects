This repository contains some of the programming assignments in CS classes that I have taken in college. They include:

- Good old Minesweepers game, command-line version.
- A simple ice-cream serving game that implements stacks and queues.
- A short version of traditional 20 Questions game, implementing binary tree.

### Minesweepers

- A classic Minesweepers game using the command line. Run the Minesweepers.java file in a terminal to start the game. Instructions will be provided before game starts.

### Ice Cream Factory

- A simple game where you add ice cream scoops so as to match a given ice cream generated by the computer.
- Stacks and queues are implemented to keep track of ice cream scoops.

### 20 Questions Game

- Run GuessingGamePrespecified.jar for a restricted version of the game, where you choose one of the 20 options for answers, then follow the questions to see if the computer can guess it.
- Run GuessingGameUnrestricted.jar for an open version of the game, where you can think of any particular app; and if the computer gets it wrong you can provide your answer at the end of the game to improve it.
